# Virtual Pets Re-Imagined
## Overview
Do you remember Cyberpet? Tamagotchi? Digimon? Petz? Virtual pets like these were born in 1996. With your help, they will be reborn. Virtual Toys, Inc. wants you to build the next iteration of virtual pets to market to adults who enjoy updated versions of the toys and games they played in their youth.  This game will be like the virtual pets of 1996...but so much more. It’s Virtual Pets Re-Imagined with your own personal touch!

# User Step 1

Our Virtual Pet program is a console application where a user can create a pet, set their pet's name and species. The pet also has different feature properties such as hunger, boredom, and health.
The user will first start with having the option to choose between an Organic or Robotic pet type.
Then the user must choose a slot within the shelter to store their pet.  Slots 1-4 are reserved for Organic. Slot 5-8 are reserved for Robotic
After the user chooses a type and slot, they will be taken to the amin menu:
Console.WriteLine("Menu");
Console.WriteLine("0 Create new Pet");  -----------------------**Gives member option to create new pet.
Console.WriteLine("1 Name");            -----------------------**Option to create a name for pet.
Console.WriteLine("2 Species");         -----------------------**Option to create species.
Console.WriteLine("3 Pet interaction ");-----------------------**Opens up new menu for user to interact with a specific pet.
Console.WriteLine("4 Interact with pets in shelter");----------**Open up new menu for user to ineract with all pets within shelter.
Console.WriteLine("5 Adopt or Remove your pet to shelter");----**Gives the user an option to Adopt or Remove Pet from Shelter.
Console.WriteLine("q Exit");-----------------------------------**Allows user to exit game. 


# Extra
Did you know that you could change the color of text in console applications and add sounds? That's pretty cool, and a decent way to add some flair to your project if you get finished early. (From Gavin: AND ONLY IF YOU GET FINISHED EARLY! Also, there are sounds, which I think are pretty cool. Might be a fun thing to try out!)
